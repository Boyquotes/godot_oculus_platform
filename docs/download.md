There are two versions right now:

- [Stable](https://github.com/decacis/godot_oculus_platform/releases)
- [Development](https://github.com/decacis/godot_oculus_platform/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

The stable version will have less features but they will be more tested. Development versions have more features but they haven't been tested as thoroughly as the stable versions.

In the case of the development versions, look for an artifact with a name similar to `OculusPlatformSDK-51-for-godot-4.0.2-stable_v0.0.1-alpha`

**NOTE:** "stable" is used pretty loosely at the moment. Expect usage API changes in the future.
